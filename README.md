Backend Assignment:

Tech Stacks used: NodeJS,ExpressJS,MongoDB,JWT(For Authentication)

I have developed the backend for a Basic Activity Booking App. Users can register and log in using secure authentication. The available activity list is seeded via a seeder.js file and is publicly accessible without login. Once logged in, users can book activities by their userId. Each user can view only the activities they have booked â€” bookings are private and user-specific. Unauthorized users cannot access or book activities.

I have seeded three activities. Those _id's are 681a3fb0ec9e950fd129e18d,681a3fb0ec9e950fd129e18c and 681a3fb0ec9e950fd129e18b.

I have included postman collections for API Testing.
